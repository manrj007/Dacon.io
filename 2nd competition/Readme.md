**Background**

There are three main ways to buy a house in Korea.

1. The 1st way is to choose appropriate apartment through the real estate agents.
2. The 2nd is to buy an apartment from the constructor.
3. The 3rd way is to use the real estate auctions.

In general, Korean feel difficult it and they think that they cannot even begin to get started. They are worried that if they make a reckless move without knowing the laws related to the analysis of rights and related to the laws, they could lose their seed money.

    Is the real estate auction really difficult and dangerous? Yoon Soohyun(39 old) author of “the 365-month rent account”, She said in an interview in the Hankook Daily(Korea newspaper) “It is just a misunderstanding and prejudice”. The author argues that the more seed money is lacking, the more we should find a way at auction.
